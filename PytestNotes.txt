Using pytest:

1- Download pytest
2- For file func.py, write test file func_test.py which contains the functions of func.py with the word test before them
and tries to assert for some correct example

# can use pytest.approx for float results to avoid epsilon errors 

Can template input to test functions

Use -v to write which tests r working
